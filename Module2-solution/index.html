				<h2>Analog Computers</h2>
			</div>
			<p>These computers were specifically designed to process analogue data. For readers who are not familiar with the term, analogue data is a type of continuous data that continually changes and does not have discrete values. It can also be said that analogue computers are used when the users are not familiar with the exact values like temperature, speed, current, and pressure. An intriguing feature of analogue computers is accepting the measuring device's data without converting it into relevant codes and numbers. Some examples of analogue computers are the mercury thermometer and speedometer</p>

				<h2>Digital Computers</h2>
			</div>
			<p>Digital computers were invented to perform different calculations and logical operations at a very high speed. These computers accept the raw data as input, done in binary numbers (0 and 1) or digitals. After that, the device processes the information with programs that are already stored in the device's memory. This process is followed to generate the output. Some examples of digital computers include laptops, desktops, and other electronic devices like smartphones.</p>

				<h2>Hybrid Computers</h2>
			</div>
			<p>Hybrid computers are devices that have features of both digital and analog computers. These devices are similar in speed to analog computers and are identical to digital computers in their memory and accuracy. Hybrid computers can process both discrete and continuous data. These devices work by accepting analog signals and converting those signals into a digital form before processing. This is why these devices are popularly used in specialized applications where both analog and digital data has to be processed. For example, the processors used in petrol pumps convert fuel flow into values for both quantity and price. Similar devices are used in hospitals, airplanes, and many scientific applications.</p>
